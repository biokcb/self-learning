# Random Data Analysis

Just playing around with using Python to analyze and visualize random datasets. Datasets are described for each separate project, but not uploaded.

College scorecard: This data set was obtained from https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/  to be analyzed on September 24, 2018. The analysis will cover exploratory analysis, summary statistics, data cleaning, and visualization. There will be a final report reporting any interesting findings, but mainly I used this to practice these skills in Python using the pandas and bokeh packages.
