# self-learning
A personal repository for practicing and learning new concepts. Any real projects will be published to a separate repository. This is really just for playing around. 

### Current Learning
Everything I'm actively working on learning and updating scripts for.

#### Data science
  1. Kaggle competition data sets. (https://www.kaggle.com/)
      * Starting with the classic titanic data set supplemented with learning through the Bioinformatics Club Machine Learning team 
  2. UC Irvine ML Data Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)
  3. Personal projects: Random datasets I've come across that I'd like to explore
      * College scorecard. A lot of data about colleges in the US. 
  4. Datacamp (https://www.datacamp.com/). Bioinformatics club members have free access to to course materials, so I figured this would be a good way to learn how to do data science in Python (prior experience in R, but not much)
      * Data scientist with Python track - DC projects in python

#### MIT OCW - Algorithms 6.006
To gain a fundamental understanding of algorithms in computer science I'm watching the lectures and working through the problem sets myself to learn. First implement in Python, but would be a good place to practice in other languages after that.

#### Python
Extra practice solving problems in Python outside of my dissertation project, side projects, and the above. 

### Future Learning
Items next on the list to invest time into. Will start once the above are done or have made significant progress on (>50%)

#### C++
After running through tutorials (https://www.learncpp.com/), go through practice problems on HackerRank and Rosalind using C++. Possibly also the algorithms coursework from above.   

#### Julia
Practice data science and programming in Julia. (https://julialang.org/)

### Past Learning
Everything I've completed and am no longer updating - nothing yet.
