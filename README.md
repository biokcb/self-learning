# self-learning
A personal repository for practicing and learning new concepts. Any real projects will be published to a separate repository. This is really just for playing around and going through problem sets. 

## Current Learning
Everything I'm actively working on learning and updating scripts for.

### Data science
  1. Kaggle competition data sets. (https://www.kaggle.com/)
      * Starting with the classic titanic data set supplemented with learning through the Bioinformatics Club Machine Learning team 
  2. UC Irvine ML Data Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)
  3. Datacamp (https://www.datacamp.com/). Bioinformatics club members have free access to to course materials, so I figured this would be a good way to learn how to do data science in Python (prior experience in R, but not much)
      * Data scientist with Python track - DC projects in python

### MIT OCW - Algorithms 6.006
To gain a fundamental understanding of algorithms in computer science I'm watching the lectures and working through the problem sets myself to learn. First implement in Python, but would be a good place to practice in other languages after that.

### Rosalind
Extra practice coding (any language) by solving problems on Rosalind (http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) which are relevant to bioinformatic algorithms. Will eventually contain multiple languages.

## Future Learning
Items next on the list to invest time into. Will start once the above are done or have made significant progress on (>50%)

### Python
Extra practice solving problems in Python outside of my dissertation project, side projects, and the above. For now, I think I am getting plenty of practice so if I start this up in the future it will be generally dedicated to practicing new libraries or problems on hacker rank for example. Most of my projects are Python-based so I am not sure I will start a separate 'learning' folder for it just yet.

### C++
After running through tutorials (https://www.learncpp.com/), go through practice problems on HackerRank and Rosalind using C++. Possibly also the algorithms coursework from above.   

### Julia
Practice data science and programming in Julia. (https://julialang.org/)

## Past Learning
Everything I've completed and am no longer updating.

  * Rosalind/perl/ - When I first started doing Rosalind problems I was practicing Perl, but I am no longer using perl except to read/update/convert legacy code, so I am no longer working on Rosalind in perl.
