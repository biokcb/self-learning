# self-learning
A personal repository for organizing, practicing, and learning new concepts. Any real projects will be published to a separate repository. This is really just for playing around with new concepts, going through problem sets and courses, and organizing my thoughts and priorities.

## Current Learning
Everything I'm actively working on learning. These are all likely to be super basic tutorial/homework problem/example style things. When I really want to dive deeper, I'll likely make a new project repository. Some of this is just me "scheduling" out my learning/side projects because I like to be organized.

### Data science
I have some limited data science and analysis experience in R & Python and am learning more with a couple people from Bioinformatics Club at CSU. Someday hoping to apply these skills to some bioinformatics research project. For now, here is what I am working on:
  1. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
      * Starting with the classic titanic data set supplemented with learning through the [Bioinformatics Club](https://github.com/CSUBioinformatics) Machine Learning team
      * Participating with Steven, Sean, and Jim in the Petfinder.my competition
  2. [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). Bioinformatics club members have free access to to course materials, so I figured this would be a good way to learn how to do data science in Python & R, languages I more regularly use.
      * Data scientist tracks

### C/C++
I've been going through two books, *How to think like a computer scientist in C++* and *C++ Primer*, as well as tutorials on GitHub in C/C++, going through practice problems on HackerRank. The hope is to create some new small RNA tools in C++ as I learn more.  

### Flutter
For a side project I am working on with some folks, I am learning [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) to make some basic mobile apps based on tutorials/example code on GitHub so I can eventually apply it to this other project.

## Future Learning
Items next on the list to invest time into. Will start once the above are done or have made significant progress on (>50%)

### Julia
Practice data science and programming in [Julia](https://julialang.org/)

### MIT OCW - Algorithms 6.006
To gain a fundamental understanding of algorithms in computer science I'm watching the lectures and working through the problem sets myself to learn. First implement in *Python*, but would be a good place to practice in other languages after that.

### Rosalind
Extra practice coding (any language) by solving problems on [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) which are relevant to bioinformatic algorithms. Will eventually contain multiple languages.


## Past Learning
Everything I've completed and am no longer updating.

  * Rosalind/perl/ - When I first started doing Rosalind problems I was practicing Perl, but I am no longer using perl except to read/update/convert legacy code, so I am no longer working on Rosalind in perl.
